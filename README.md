# Contributions of adaptation and purifying selection to SARS-CoV-2 evolution

__Richard A.~Neher__

This repository contains scripts and source files associated with a manuscript on SARS-CoV-2 virus evolution.

The analysis can be run using `snakemake` and requires standard python libraries, as well as `treetime` (`phylo-treetime` in pip).

The analysis can be run using the open data files provisioned by Nextstrain (download default in the workflow).

The directory `manuscript` contains the `TeX` files associated with manuscript, the bibliography, and the figures.

The `data` directory contains some derived files, including the rate estimates, the mutation distribution, and fitness cost landscapes.
